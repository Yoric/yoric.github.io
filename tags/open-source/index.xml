      <description>&lt;p&gt;(This is meant to be the first entry of a series which will cover individual points more in depth. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how that goes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re the tech industry. We have ideas. We have ideas &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;. And we&amp;rsquo;re used to turn our ideas into applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how does it go&amp;hellip; here&amp;rsquo;s the back-end component&amp;hellip; here&amp;rsquo;s the front-end component. We&amp;rsquo;ll write the former in Python, or perhaps JavaScript, to optimize for prototyping. After all, we have &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; ideas, we need the ability to iterate quickly. Sprinkle in a few dependencies, that will speed us up. Oh, and let&amp;rsquo;s use ChatGPT and Copilot, we&amp;rsquo;ll be even faster. Oh, and performance, yeah, performance: microservices, Kafka, Redis, Kubernetes&amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;re now ready to scale up. Oh, Sentry, Prometheus and Grafana, too, where would we be without &amp;rsquo;em? For the front-end, we&amp;rsquo;ll write a website, and for mobile, Electron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait a second, we need to make money and to fidelize our users! Let me see&amp;hellip; ads, tracking, and good reasons to revisit our app, perhaps a little NFT here, gamification&amp;hellip; alright, we should be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three&amp;hellip; two&amp;hellip; one&amp;hellip; and we have shipped v1!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the world is burning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s time we revisited how we do things?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Moderated Federated Networks might actually be what we need - part 1</title>
      <link>https://yoric.github.io/post/federated-moderation-is-hard/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Among the many &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; moments of this ending year 2022, we have had the chance of
seeing the Twitter/Musk experiment unfold. I won&amp;rsquo;t spend time rehashing the many twists
of this experiment, just a moment to offer the best wishes to all who work or worked at
Twitter, in particular those being offered as scapegoats for the many sins of the C-suit,
both past and present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m going to spend time on is moderation. If we listen to the official discourse, this
entire Twitter/Musk experiment is about moderation. Also, as a direct consequence of aid
experiment, the number of users on Federated Networks such as Matrix and Mastodon has never
been so high. And Twitter, both past and present, has been a permanent demonstration that
moderation is hard. So&amp;hellip; what does it change to moderate a Federated Network?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: it&amp;rsquo;s harder, but not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The web is getting darker. It is being weaponized by trolls, bullies and bad actors and, as we&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed, this can have extremely grave consequences for individuals, groups, sometimes entire countries. So far, most of the counter-measures proposed by either governments or private actors are even scarier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creators of the Matrix protocol have recently published &lt;a href=&#34;https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors&#34;&gt;the most promising plan I have seen&lt;/a&gt;. One that I believe stands a chance of making real headway in this fight, while respecting openness, decentralization, open-source and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been offered the opportunity to work on this plan. For this reason, after 9 years as an employee at &lt;a href=&#34;https://mozilla.org&#34;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ll be moving to &lt;a href=&#34;https://element.io&#34;&gt;Element&lt;/a&gt;, where I&amp;rsquo;ll try and contribute to making the web a better place. My last day at Mozilla will be October 30th.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On this rainy october day (well, at least it rains where I&amp;rsquo;m writing this) of the great year 2020, let&amp;rsquo;s take another few minutes to reflect on &lt;a href=&#34;https://yoric.github.io/tags/mozgreatstuff/&#34;&gt;some great practices that we have at Mozilla and that would deserve to take over the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what you can do when your work is blocked.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s continue &lt;a href=&#34;https://yoric.github.io/tags/mozgreatstuff/&#34;&gt;this series&lt;/a&gt; on some of the great practices that we have at Mozilla and that your project may wish to adopt, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about &lt;a href=&#34;https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#introduction:mozilla.org&#34;&gt;Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;#introduction&lt;/code&gt; chatroom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>about:Mozilla&#39;s Mentored Bugs - and how it could work for your project</title>
      <link>https://yoric.github.io/post/moz-great-stuff/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2020 is a crappy year for pretty much everyone. As you may have seen, this includes organizations such as Mozilla. So I figured it was the best time to actually talk about good stuff! This entry should be the first of a series of short articles dedicated to some great practices we have at Mozilla and that I think many open-source projects could adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, Mozilla is a community of open-source enthusiasts. When you&amp;rsquo;re new to an open-source community and you wish to start contributing somewhere, finding an entry point is often difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where &lt;strong&gt;Mentored Bugs&lt;/strong&gt; come in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Extracting text from images is not easy (who would have guessed?)</title>

      <description>At its core, Lighthouse is an idea we have been discussing in Connected Devices: can we build a device that will help people with partial or total vision disabilities?
From there, we started a number of experiments. I figured out it was time to braindump some of them.
Our problem Consider the following example:
How do we get from this beautiful picture of Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Paris office to the text &amp;ldquo;PRIDE and PREJUDICE&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Jane Austen&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Great Books&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Great Prices&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;$9.</description>
