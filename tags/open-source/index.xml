      <description>&lt;p&gt;2020 is a crappy year for pretty much everyone. As you may have seen, this includes organizations such as Mozilla. So I figured it was the best time to actually talk about good stuff! This entry should be the first of a series of short articles dedicated to some great practices we have at Mozilla and that I think many open-source projects could adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, Mozilla is a community of open-source enthusiasts. When you&amp;rsquo;re new to an open-source community and you wish to start contributing somewhere, finding an entry point is often difficult
That&amp;rsquo;s where &lt;strong&gt;Mentored Bugs&lt;/strong&gt; come in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>At its core, Lighthouse is an idea we have been discussing in Connected Devices: can we build a device that will help people with partial or total vision disabilities?
From there, we started a number of experiments. I figured out it was time to braindump some of them.
Our problem Consider the following example:
How do we get from this beautiful picture of Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Paris office to the text &amp;ldquo;PRIDE and PREJUDICE&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Jane Austen&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Great Books&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Great Prices&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;$9.</description>
