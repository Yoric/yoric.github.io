      <description>&lt;p&gt;So you want to optimize your code, eh? Who am I to blame you? &lt;a href=&#34;../coding-for-a-finite-world/&#34;&gt;I certainly want you to optimize your code&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent a few years as part of the Firefox Performance Team, on the frontline of, well, performance. I still
bear some of the scars. So, as the grizzled perf-veteran that I have decided to be for the day, let
me invite you to sit down for a while and share a little hard-earned experience on code optimization.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(This is meant to be the first entry of a series which will cover individual points more in depth. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how that goes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re the tech industry. We have ideas. We have ideas &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;. And we&amp;rsquo;re used to turn our ideas into applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, how does it go&amp;hellip; here&amp;rsquo;s the back-end component&amp;hellip; here&amp;rsquo;s the front-end component. We&amp;rsquo;ll write the former in Python, or perhaps JavaScript, to optimize for prototyping. After all, we have &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; ideas, we need the ability to iterate quickly. Sprinkle in a few dependencies, that will speed us up. Oh, and let&amp;rsquo;s use ChatGPT and Copilot, we&amp;rsquo;ll be even faster. Oh, and performance, yeah, performance: microservices, Kafka, Redis, Kubernetes&amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;re now ready to scale up. Oh, Sentry, Prometheus and Grafana, too, where would we be without &amp;rsquo;em? For the front-end, we&amp;rsquo;ll write a website, and for mobile, Electron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait a second, we need to make money and to fidelize our users! Let me see&amp;hellip; ads, tracking, and good reasons to revisit our app, perhaps a little NFT here, gamification&amp;hellip; alright, we should be good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three&amp;hellip; two&amp;hellip; one&amp;hellip; and we have shipped v1!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the world is burning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s time we revisited how we do things?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent publications by &lt;a href=&#34;https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Memory-Safety-Convening-Report-1-1.pdf&#34;&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/10/2003112742/-1/-1/0/CSI_SOFTWARE_MEMORY_SAFETY.PDF&#34;&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt; have launched countless conversations in development circles about &lt;em&gt;safety&lt;/em&gt; and its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these conversations, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many misunderstandings about what safety means in programming and how programming languages can implement, help or hinder safety. Let&amp;rsquo;s clarify a few things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The web is getting darker. It is being weaponized by trolls, bullies and bad actors and, as we&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed, this can have extremely grave consequences for individuals, groups, sometimes entire countries. So far, most of the counter-measures proposed by either governments or private actors are even scarier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creators of the Matrix protocol have recently published &lt;a href=&#34;https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors&#34;&gt;the most promising plan I have seen&lt;/a&gt;. One that I believe stands a chance of making real headway in this fight, while respecting openness, decentralization, open-source and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been offered the opportunity to work on this plan. For this reason, after 9 years as an employee at &lt;a href=&#34;https://mozilla.org&#34;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ll be moving to &lt;a href=&#34;https://element.io&#34;&gt;Element&lt;/a&gt;, where I&amp;rsquo;ll try and contribute to making the web a better place. My last day at Mozilla will be October 30th.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On this rainy october day (well, at least it rains where I&amp;rsquo;m writing this) of the great year 2020, let&amp;rsquo;s take another few minutes to reflect on &lt;a href=&#34;https://yoric.github.io/tags/mozgreatstuff/&#34;&gt;some great practices that we have at Mozilla and that would deserve to take over the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about &lt;a href=&#34;https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#introduction:mozilla.org&#34;&gt;Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code&gt;#introduction&lt;/code&gt; chatroom&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>about:Mozilla&#39;s Mentored Bugs - and how it could work for your project</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2020 is a crappy year for pretty much everyone. As you may have seen, this includes organizations such as Mozilla. So I figured it was the best time to actually talk about good stuff! This entry should be the first of a series of short articles dedicated to some great practices we have at Mozilla and that I think many open-source projects could adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, Mozilla is a community of open-source enthusiasts. When you&amp;rsquo;re new to an open-source community and you wish to start contributing somewhere, finding an entry point is often difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where &lt;strong&gt;Mentored Bugs&lt;/strong&gt; come in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Did Mozilla Remove XUL Add-ons?</title>
      <link>https://yoric.github.io/post/why-did-mozilla-remove-xul-addons/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 18:09:36 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yoric.github.io/post/why-did-mozilla-remove-xul-addons/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Firefox used to have a great extension mechanism based on the XUL and XPCOM. This mechanism served us well for a long time. However, it came at an ever-growing cost in terms of maintenance for both Firefox developers and add-on developers. On one side, this growing cost progressively killed any effort to make Firefox secure, fast or to try new things. On the other side, this growing cost progressively killed the community of add-on developers. Eventually, after spending years trying to protect this old add-on mechanism, Mozilla made the hard choice of removing this extension mechanism and replacing this with the less powerful but much more maintainable WebExtensions API. Thanks to this choice, Firefox developers can once again make the necessary changes to improve security, stability or speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the past few days, I&amp;rsquo;ve been chatting with Firefox users, trying to separate fact from rumor regarding the consequences of the August 2020 Mozilla layoffs. One of the topics that came back a few times was the removal of XUL-based add-ons during the move to Firefox Quantum. I was very surprised to see that, years after it happened, some community members still felt hurt by this choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, as someone pointed out on reddit, I realized that we still haven&amp;rsquo;t taken the time to explain in-depth why we &lt;em&gt;had no choice&lt;/em&gt; but to remove XUL-based add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you&amp;rsquo;re ready for a dive into some of the internals of add-ons and Gecko, I&amp;rsquo;d like to take this opportunity to try and give you a bit more detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Possibly one step towards named arguments in Rust</title>
      <link>https://yoric.github.io/post/rust-named-arguments/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A number of programming languages offer a feature called &amp;ldquo;Named Arguments&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Labeled Arguments&amp;rdquo;, which
makes some function calls much more readable and safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see how hard it would be to add these in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Units of Measure in Rust with Refinement Types</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Years ago, Andrew Kennedy published &lt;a href=&#34;http://typesatwork.imm.dtu.dk/material/TaW_Paper_TypesAtWork_Kennedy.pdf&#34;&gt;a foundational paper&lt;/a&gt; about a type checker for units of measure, and later &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/andrewkennedy/units-of-measure-in-f-part-one-introducing-units&#34;&gt;implemented it for
F#&lt;/a&gt;. To this day, F# is the only mainstream programming language which provides first class support to make sure that you will not accidentally confuse meters and feet, euros and dollars, but that you can still convert between watts·hours and joules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to see whether this could be implemented in and for Rust. The answer is not only yes, but it was fun :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m the author of this blog post, 99% of the work was done by Nicolas B. Pierron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, my role in this project has largely been to play the wise old advisor,
nodding and smiling mischeviously whenever Nicolas started exploring new ideas,
and emitting cryptic comments in Reverse Jedi Notation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, we published a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mozilla.org/javascript/2017/10/20/holyjit-a-new-hope/&#34;&gt;short (and mysterious) blog post&lt;/a&gt; in which we
mentioned HolyJIT, an early research project towards a novel approach to writing JITs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I would like to detail a bit more the ideas behind HolyJIT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JavaScript Binary AST diaries - How to replace proving with validating for fun and profit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this entry, I’d like to discuss one of the most interesting and unusual aspects of the Binary AST: how we gain performance by turning &lt;em&gt;proof-building&lt;/em&gt; into &lt;em&gt;validation&lt;/em&gt;, and why this is very good news for performance (and maybe not so good news for file size).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Binary AST - Motivations and Design Decisions - Part 1</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The key to making programs fast is to make them do practically nothing.&amp;rdquo; - Mike Haertel, creator of GNU Grep.
Binary AST - &amp;ldquo;Binary Abstract Syntax Tree&amp;rdquo; - is Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s proposal for specifying a binary-encoded syntax for JS with the intent of allowing browsers and other JS-executing environments to parse and load code as much as 80% faster than standard minified JS.
It has recently cleared Stage 1 of the TC39 standards process, and while the final byte-level format isn&amp;rsquo;t completely nailed down, we&amp;rsquo;re confident that the final implementation will deliver the impressive performance improvements promised by the prototype.</description>

      <title>JavaScript Binary AST Engineering Newsletter #1</title>
      <link>https://yoric.github.io/post/binary-ast-engineering-newsletter-1/</link>

      <guid>https://yoric.github.io/post/binary-ast-engineering-newsletter-1/</guid>
      <description>Hey, all cool kids have exciting Engineering Newsletters these days, so it&amp;rsquo;s high time the JavaScript Binary AST got one!
Summary JavaScript Binary AST is a joint project between Mozilla and Facebook to rethink how JavaScript source code is stored/transmitted/parsed. We expect that this project will help visibly speed up the loading of large codebases of JS applications and will have a large impact on the JS development community, including both web developers, Node developers, add-on developers and ourselves.</description>

      <description>In this blog post, I would like to introduce the JavaScript Binary AST, an ongoing project that we hope will help make webpages load faster, along with a number of other benefits.
A little background Over the years, JavaScript has grown from one of the slowest scripting languages available to a high-performance powerhouse, fast enough that it can run desktop, server, mobile and even embedded applications, whether through web browsers or other environments.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, Mozilla pulled the plug on its Connected Devices Experiment: a bunch of internal non-profit hardware-related startups. One of our main objectives was to determine if we could come up with designs that could help turn the tide against the spyware-riddled and gruyère-level security devices that are currently being offered (or pushed) to unwary users.
One of the startups was Project Lighthouse. We tried to provide an affordable, simple and privacy-friendly tool for people suffering from vision impairment and who needed help in their daily life.</description>

      <title>Extracting text from images is not easy (who would have guessed?)</title>

      <guid>https://yoric.github.io/post/extracting-text-from-images/</guid>
      <description>At its core, Lighthouse is an idea we have been discussing in Connected Devices: can we build a device that will help people with partial or total vision disabilities?
From there, we started a number of experiments. I figured out it was time to braindump some of them.
Our problem Consider the following example:
How do we get from this beautiful picture of Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s Paris office to the text &amp;ldquo;PRIDE and PREJUDICE&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Jane Austen&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Great Books&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Great Prices&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;$9.</description>
