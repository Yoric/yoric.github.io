      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that all projects die, eventually, and that most projects die&#xA;before they have had a chance to have any impact. This is true of personal projects,&#xA;of open-source projects, of startup projects, of hardware projects, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Connected_Devices/Projects/Project_Lighthouse&#34;&gt;the IoT project on which I was working&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;did just that. It was funded, it was open-source, it was open-hardware, and it&#xA;still died before having the opportunity to release anything useful. In our case,&#xA;we got pretty far, didn&amp;rsquo;t run out of funds, and were a little polish away from&#xA;putting our first alpha-testers in front of a pretty advanced prototype before&#xA;a higher-level strategy pivot killed a number of projects at once.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ah, well, risks of the trade.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, working on it, we managed to learn or come up with a few tricks&#xA;to increase the chances of surviving at least long enough to release a product.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ll try to summarize and explain some of these tricks here. Hopefully, if you&#xA;have a project, regardless of funding and medium, you may find some of this&#xA;summary useful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
