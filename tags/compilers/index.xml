      <title>AI code plus performance minus brittle = ?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a path towards AI that actually produces high-reliability, high-performance code, and it goes through formal methods and compilers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generative AI has been something of a controversial topic among developers. Some claim that it&amp;rsquo;s making their life easier, or even that they don&amp;rsquo;t need to code anymore and can let some agent do the job. Others claim that it&amp;rsquo;s unreliable, that it&amp;rsquo;s operating at the wrong level, and that it will never successfully replace developers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few point out (correctly) that Earth simply cannot sustain the exponential energy requirements of AI – or even the exponential money demands of some famous AI company.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For this post, let&amp;rsquo;s assume that Generative AI is here to say, and that it will eventually write (almost) all the code. This is by no mean a certainty, but it&amp;rsquo;s a possible scenario, or even a self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this happens, there are two directions in which code-written-by-AI goes. Either AI will get better at writing reliable code, or we&amp;rsquo;ll get used to rolling dice whenever we use an AI to write code, and more often than not, end up with bad, bug-riddled, unreliable and slow AI-generated code. But hey, we&amp;rsquo;ll have managed to layoff all the developers (and all the voice actors, all the paralegals, all the book illustrators, etc.) so the money will flow and everybody&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; will be happy. Let&amp;rsquo;s be frank: given how the industry has evolved during the last ~40 years, the second option is the most likely. But maybe, just maybe, there is a path towards good AI code&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What would it take to add refinement types to Rust?</title>
      <link>https://yoric.github.io/post/rust-refinement-types/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, on a whim, I wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://yoric.github.io/post/uom.rs/&#34;&gt;YAIOUOM&lt;/a&gt;. YAOIOUM was a static analyzer for Rust that checked that the code&#xA;was using units of measures correctly, e.g. a distance in meters is not a distance in centimeters, dividing meters&#xA;by seconds gave you a value in &lt;code&gt;m / s&lt;/code&gt; (aka &lt;code&gt;m * s^-1&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;YAIOUOM was an example of a &lt;em&gt;refinement type system&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. a type system that does its work after another type&#xA;system has already done its work. It was purely static, users could add new units in about&#xA;one line of code, and it was actually surprisingly easy to write. It also couldn&amp;rsquo;t be written within the Rust&#xA;type system, in part because I wanted legible error messages, and in part because Rust doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer a very&#xA;good way to specify that &lt;code&gt;(m / s) * s&lt;/code&gt; is actually the same type as &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, it also worked only on a specific version of Rust Nightly, and the code broke down with every new version&#xA;of Rust. It&amp;rsquo;s a shame, because I believe that there&amp;rsquo;s lots we could do with refinement types. Simple things such&#xA;as units of measure, as above, but also, I suspect, we could achieve much better error messages for complex&#xA;type-level programming, such as what Diesel is doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It got me to wonder how we could extend Rust in such a way that refinement types could be easily added&#xA;to the language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
