      <title>(Quite) A Few Words About Async</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few conversations about async code recently (and not so&#xA;recently) and seen some code that seems to make wrong assumptions&#xA;about async, so I figured out it was time to have a serious chat&#xA;about async, what it&amp;rsquo;s for, what it guarantees and what it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Programming Languages That Blew My Mind</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been a programmer since the age of 8, and some kind of developer for most of my life. Throughout my&#xA;life as a coder, both hobbyist and professional, I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt plenty of programming languages that felt&#xA;like cookie-cutter clones of each other, but also a few programming languages that changed the way I&#xA;looked at programming, sometimes even at thinking.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;(This is meant to be the first entry of a series which will cover individual points more in depth. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how that goes.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re the tech industry. We have ideas. We have ideas &lt;em&gt;all the time&lt;/em&gt;. And we&amp;rsquo;re used to turn our ideas into applications.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, how does it go&amp;hellip; here&amp;rsquo;s the back-end component&amp;hellip; here&amp;rsquo;s the front-end component. We&amp;rsquo;ll write the former in Python, or perhaps JavaScript, to optimize for prototyping. After all, we have &lt;em&gt;so many&lt;/em&gt; ideas, we need the ability to iterate quickly. Sprinkle in a few dependencies, that will speed us up. Oh, and let&amp;rsquo;s use ChatGPT and Copilot, we&amp;rsquo;ll be even faster. Oh, and performance, yeah, performance: microservices, Kafka, Redis, Kubernetes&amp;hellip; we&amp;rsquo;re now ready to scale up. Oh, Sentry, Prometheus and Grafana, too, where would we be without &amp;rsquo;em? For the front-end, we&amp;rsquo;ll write a website, and for mobile, Electron.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Oh, wait a second, we need to make money and to fidelize our users! Let me see&amp;hellip; ads, tracking, and good reasons to revisit our app, perhaps a little NFT here, gamification&amp;hellip; alright, we should be good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Three&amp;hellip; two&amp;hellip; one&amp;hellip; and we have shipped v1!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, the world is burning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s time we revisited how we do things?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Project Lighthouse: A post-mortem</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, Mozilla pulled the plug on its Connected Devices Experiment:&#xA;a bunch of internal non-profit hardware-related startups. One of our main&#xA;objectives was to determine if we could come up with designs that could help&#xA;turn the tide against the spyware-riddled and gruyère-level security devices that are&#xA;currently being offered (or pushed) to unwary users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the startups was &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Connected_Devices/Projects/Project_Lighthouse&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Project Lighthouse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We tried to provide an&#xA;affordable, simple and privacy-friendly tool for people suffering from&#xA;vision impairment and who needed help in their daily life. While Mozilla&#xA;closed the experiment before we could release anything useful, we still came&#xA;up with a few nifty ideas. Here is a post-mortem, in the hope that, maybe,&#xA;someone will be able to succeed where we couldn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
