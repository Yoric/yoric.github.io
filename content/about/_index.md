Hi, I'm Yoric, aka David Teller, I'm a Jack of all Threads at Mozilla and I
produce code, speed, programming languages and performance data for a living.

I've been spotted spending time on

- the SpiderMonkey JavaScript Virtual Machine;
- a micro-kernel;
- a next-gen browser engine;
- a few compilers;
- static analyzers;
- a few eBook readers;
- a programming language designed for multi-tiered web applications and services whose components distrust each other;
- a programming language designed for always-on, fault-tolerant, reboot-tolerant, hardware-replacement-tolerant, power-limited IoT applications;
- IoT for the disabled;
- IoT snooping countermeasure experiment;
- pedagogic robots;
- open-source mentoring;
- university teaching;
- high-school teaching;
- academic research;
- also, backpacking through exotic countries;
- ...
