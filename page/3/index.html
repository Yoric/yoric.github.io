	<div class="entry__content"><p>I have decided to keep this blog for professional use and move everything related
to storytelling, role-playing games or improv acting to a new location.</p>
<p>Without further ado, let me introduce <a href="http://spacetimewilltell.yoric.xyz/">Space·Time Will Tell</a>!</p>
<p>At the menu:</p>
<ul>
<li>a comic book tutorial for Fate RPG!</li>
<li>using Tarot-like cards for storytelling!</li>
<li>several elevator pitches for stories I haven&rsquo;t had the time to write!</li>
<li>the Space·Time Deck!</li>
<li>the Ronin Time Bureaucrats!</li>
<li>adventure and excitement!</li>
</ul>
<p>See you on the other side :)</p></div>

	<div class="entry__content"><p>Well, it&rsquo;s simple, really: every question has an answer, and somewhere in Space·Time, there is someone who has that answer. Do you want that answer? Do you want it? Well, <strong>Time Will Tell, Inc.</strong> can get it. Sign up with us, and we&rsquo;ll send a team of highly trained Space·Time operatives after that very special person who knows.</p></div>

	<div class="entry__content"><p>After the debacle of the Space·Time Fleet and the loss of many of its Continuum Indirections to imploded Pocket Continuums, the idea of a large Space·Time force was very nearly shelved, and its remaining ships docked. Some of the surviving cadres of the Space·Time Fleet, however, took advantage of this lack of purpose, and came up with an idea to salvage some of the huge costs sunk into the fleet itself. Most of the onboard weaponry was dismantled, many soldiers were retrained or replaced by scientists, and the <strong>Time Federation</strong> was born, with a new purpose: boldly go when noone has gone before, discover old and future civilizations and endlessly debate whether the Prime Space·Time Directive – initially designed to avoid Observable Contradictions – applies in that Octant of the Continuum.</p></div>

	<h1 class="entry__title title-excerpt"><a class="entry__title-link" href="http://localhost:1313/post/thinkerbell-postmortem/">Thinkerbell Postmortem/Brain dump</a></h1>
	<div class="entry__content"><p>Two years ago, I was working on a research project called &ldquo;Project Link&rdquo; as part of
the Connected Devices branch of Mozilla. While this branch has since been stopped,
some part of Project Link lives on as <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/02/06/announcing-project-things-open-framework-connecting-devices-web/">Project Things</a>.</p>
<p>One of the parts of Project Link that hasn&rsquo;t made it to Project Things (so far)
was Thinkerbell: a Domain-Specific Language designed to let users program their SmartHome
without coding. While only parts of Thinkerbell were ever implemented, they were sufficient
to write programs such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever I press any button labelled &ldquo;light&rdquo; in the living room, toggle all the lights in the living room.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the entry door is locked and the motion detector notices motion, send an alarm to my SmartPhone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thinkerbell also had:</p>
<ul>
<li>semantics that ensured that scripts could continue/resume running unmonitored even when hardware
was replaced/upgraded/moved around the house, including both the server and the sensors;</li>
<li>a visual syntax, rather than a text syntax;</li>
<li>a novel type system designed to avoid physical accidents;</li>
<li>a semantics based on process algebras.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, I&rsquo;d like to take the time to write a research paper on Thinkerbell, but
realistically, there is very little chance that I&rsquo;ll find that time.
So, rather than letting these ideas die in some corner of my brain, here is a post-mortem
for Thinkerbell, in the hope that someone, somewhere, will pick some of the stuff and gives
it a second life.</p>
<p>Note that some of the ideas exposed here were never actually implemented. Project Link
was cancelled while Thinkerbell was still in its infancy.</p></div>

<p><strong>Credit</strong></p>
<p>While I&rsquo;m the author of this blog post, 99% of the work was done by Nicolas B. Pierron.</p>
<p>So far, my role in this project has largely been to play the wise old advisor,
nodding and smiling mischeviously whenever Nicolas started exploring new ideas,
and emitting cryptic comments in Reverse Jedi Notation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few months ago, we published a <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/javascript/2017/10/20/holyjit-a-new-hope/">short (and mysterious) blog post</a> in which we
mentioned HolyJIT, an early research project towards a novel approach to writing JITs.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I would like to detail a bit more the ideas behind HolyJIT.</p></div>
