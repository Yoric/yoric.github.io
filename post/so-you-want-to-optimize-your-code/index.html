  <h2 id="a-story" class="pagebody-header">
    A story
  </h2>
</div><p class="component-content component">It all starts with a story. A long time ago, in a galaxy far far away, toiled a developer who intended to make Firefox
faster. One of the things that slowed down Firefox was that the disk was accessed on the main thread. If the disk
was too busy, or waking up from sleep, this could cause the Firefox user interface to freeze for up to three seconds.</p>
<p class="component-content component">That wasn&rsquo;t good. Our intrepid developer was in charge of making sure that this didn&rsquo;t happen anymore. This meant
moving all disk accesses to another thread, which was complicated by the fact that, for historical reasons, all
the APIs that needed to access the disk were synchronous.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Anyway, after countless weeks carefully moving things across threads, making sure that unit tests passed (this
required expanding the unit test framework to allow async tests), making sure that the integration tests passed
(same story), making sure that the performance tests passed (no changes needed, lucky him) and testing manually,
our developer finally merged the task and informed the rest of the team that he was done with this one file
access.</p>
<p class="component-content component">It was then that Firefox started breaking apart in weird an unexpected places. Crash Scene Investigations reported
a surge in crash reports from Firefox Nightly. Reverting and debugging ensued.
In the end, the culprit was identified. It was the dreaded <em>nested event loop</em>, an API (called elsewhere in
the code) that can do weird things with causality. After much more debugging and blood sacrifices, and a complete
refactoring of the shutdown code of the browser, said nested event loop was tamed, the code merged and performance
improved.</p>
<p class="component-content component">The anonymous developer happily moved on to the next file access.</p>

  </h2>
</div><p class="component-content component">Despite the countless weeks spent working on this optimization, this story is actually one when things went reasonably
well:</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ol>
<li>There were plenty of tests (even if these tests didn&rsquo;t catch the issue);</li>
<li>There were additional safeguards, with Firefox Nightly, Crash Reports and volunteer testers (which did catch the issue);</li>
<li>There were a process and a mechanism that allowed our anonymous hero to backout the culprit without compromising the product;</li>
<li>The code, while quite large, was well-tested, well-documented and clear enough that performing further refactorings was possible in the first place;</li>
<li>The many teams involved were all aware of the difficulty of the task, of its importance, and were ready to spend a little time brainstorming or reviewing solutions, even if they required some sophisticated rearchitecturing.</li>
</ol></div>
<p class="component-content component">Critically, all these points were in place <em>before</em> the optimization began. If they had not been, the story
would have ended considerably worse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="component-content component"><strong>Lesson 1</strong> Make sure that your code is ready for optimizations.</p>
<p class="component-content component">You will break things during optimization. Some of the things you break will be your fault. Some were already
broken, and you&rsquo;ll just have made them visible.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>If you can&rsquo;t detect breakages, you&rsquo;re killing your product.</li>
<li>If you can&rsquo;t revert your optimizations, you&rsquo;re killing your product.</li>
<li>If your processes or tools won&rsquo;t let you fix breakages that arise, you&rsquo;re setting yourself up for failure.</li>
</ul></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="component-content component">There are many ways to make sure that your code is ready for optimization. Documentation may not be sufficient.
Static types may not be sufficient. Unit tests may not be sufficient. Integration tests may not be sufficient.
Manual tests may not be sufficient. A crowd of testers may not be sufficient. Crash reporting may not be sufficient.
But every one of these things that you&rsquo;re missing is a hole in your defenses.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="component-content component"><strong>Lesson 2</strong> Defend in depth.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="component-content component">And yes, that lesson is also valid for safety and for security.</p>

<div class="component-content pagebody component">
  <h2 id="a-story-1" class="pagebody-header">
    A story
  </h2>
</div><p class="component-content component">This story takes place earlier in the history of Firefox. A new contender had recently joined the arena, an upstart
called Chrome. The Firefox teams were cringing a little bit because the name Chrome belonged to them (the chrome
being the historical name of the Firefox front-end), more so because users claimed that Chrome was much faster than
Firefox and even more so because the benchmarks disagreed.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Let me repeat this. Pretty much every single benchmark indicated that, by right, Firefox was faster than Chrome.
After immense optimization work by the SpiderMonkey team, JavaScript code completed its tasks faster on Firefox
than on Chrome. Files downloaded faster on Firefox than on Chrome. Pages completed rendering faster on Firefox
than on Chrome. Firefox even took way less memory than Chrome.</p>
<p class="component-content component">And yet, pretty much every single user reported the opposite.</p>
<p class="component-content component">It took the Firefox teams perhaps one year to figure out what was going on. The developers were measuring how long it took
for a file to <em>complete</em> download. Users cared about how long it took for the browser to indicate that the download had
<em>started</em>. The developers were measuring how long it took for a page to <em>finish</em> rendering. Users cared about how long it
took for the page to <em>start</em> displaying. The developers were measuring how long it took for JavaScript to <em>finish</em>
execution. Users cared about how many images per second were rendered during scrolling.</p>
<p class="component-content component">It is then that they realized that they had spent the past year optimizing for the wrong metrics. And that they
started moving file I/O off the main thread.</p>

<div class="component-content pagebody component">
  <h2 id="drawing-lessons-1" class="pagebody-header">
    Drawing Lessons
  </h2>
</div><p class="component-content component">This is a case in which things could have gone much better. An entire year lost. Still, things could have been
worse. The Firefox team knew that something was off, even if they couldn&rsquo;t quite figure out what.</p>
<p class="component-content component">In this case, Mozilla had optimized for <em>throughput</em> at a time it should have focused on <em>responsiveness</em>. But
for your application, it might be something different entirely. Here are a few possibilities:</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>If you are working on mobile or IoT, you may need to optimize for <em>battery</em> and possibly <em>memory</em>.</li>
<li>If you are working on a video game, you will need to optimize for video and audio rendering <em>smoothness</em>, controls <em>responsiveness</em>.</li>
<li>If you are working on a frontend, you will need to optimize for <em>time to first rendering</em>, <em>time to first interactive</em> and <em>responsiveness</em>.</li>
<li>If you are working on a scientific tool, you will need to optimize for <em>total execution time</em>.</li>
<li>If you are working on a backend, you will need to optimize for <em>total execution time</em>, <em>memory</em>, <em>disk</em> and <em>cpu</em>.</li>
<li>If you are working at datacenter- or planetary-scale, you will need to optimize for <em>energy</em> and possibly <em>hardware wear</em>.</li>
<li>If you are working on a streaming solution, you will need to optimize for <em>bandwidth</em>.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="component-content component">In many cases, you will have more than one target. In many cases, too, targets may be contradictory.
For instance, if you&rsquo;re optimizing for <em>total execution time</em> and/or <em>responsiveness</em>, past a certain
point, this is going to cost you <em>battery</em>, <em>energy</em>, <em>cpu</em> and possibly <em>memory</em>. Possibly worse,
some of the tools used to achieve <em>responsiveness</em> is making things
async, which is going to end up increasing your <em>total execution time</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="component-content component"><strong>Lesson 3</strong> Know what you&rsquo;re optimizing <em>for</em>.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>Optimizing for the wrong metric will waste your time.</li>
<li>Optimizing for the wrong metric may push the right metric in the wrong direction.</li>
<li>Optimizing for the wrong metric will very likely make your code less ready for further optimizations.</li>
</ul></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="component-content component">Oh, by the way, how do you know what to optimize for in the first place? Maybe your code is already
optimized enough? Well, that&rsquo;s where you need your product lead to chime in, or directly your users.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="component-content component"><strong>Lesson 4</strong> Optimization is a feature.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Corollary: it may be backlogged until it becomes a priority.</p>

    A story
  </h2>
</div><p class="component-content component">Our story continues years later. Efforts to make Firefox faster had succeeded. Firefox felt smoother,
more responsive, users were largely happy. But the developers knew that this couldn&rsquo;t last. Any
add-on could slow down Firefox, freezing its user interface for arbitrary durations. Any webpage
could do the same. The solution was simple: move to a multi-process architecture. In fact, by then,
a multi-process prototype had been available for years. This architecture was better not only for
performance but also for security and reliability.</p>
<p class="component-content component">But there was a snag: the XUL model for developing add-ons was not, could demonstrably not be made
compatible with the multi-process architecture. So moving to the multi-process architecture would
mean dropping pretty much all existing add-ons and quite possibly angering the community that relied
upon these add-ons. Also, multiple processes meant a larger memory footprint.</p>
<p class="component-content component">The Firefox team dithered and delayed for several years, hoping to find a miracle solution. But
in the end, <a href="../why-did-mozilla-remove-xul-addons/">sacrifices were made</a> (you may wish to take
a look at the comment section, too, as well as comments on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24231017">HN</a>
and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/idde50/why_did_mozilla_remove_xul_addons/">Reddit</a>

  <h2 id="lessons-drawn" class="pagebody-header">
    Lessons Drawn
  </h2>
</div><p class="component-content component">Sometimes, optimizing will require sacrifices. Strike that. Optimizing <em>always</em> requires sacrifices.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>Caching results may improve your speed, but it will cost you memory, and possibly consistency.</li>
<li>Cutting features may let you get rid of inefficiencies, but it will cost you, well, features.</li>
<li>Approximating results may be how your game reaches 60fps, but players may be unhappy about weird
bounding boxes.</li>
<li>If you are splitting your backend into microservices, you are sacrificing CPU efficiency,
energy, bandwidth to gain scalability.</li>
<li>If your game needs a recent GPU to achieve decent performance, you are sacrificing some of your
userbase, in addition to natural resources, to gain smoothness.</li>
<li>If you are called Netflix, you are probably willing to trade staggering CPU time for a
small percentage of bandwidth gains.</li>
<li>If, for the sake of performance, you are using C or C++, or bringing in native modules in your
higher-level language, or bringing in external components such as Redis or Kafka,
you are accepting an extended security perimeter and lesser built-in safety.</li>
<li>In every case, you are trading away engineering time for optimization.</li>
<li>In most cases, you also make your code more complicated, trading readiness for
optimization.</li>
</ul></div>
<blockquote>
<p class="component-content component"><strong>Lesson 5</strong> Optimizations have a cost.</p>
<p class="component-content component">If you are not willing to pay this cost, do not perform the optimization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="component-content component">And since optimizations have a cost, you may run out of budget while optimizing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="component-content component"><strong>Lesson 6</strong> Scope and checkpoint your optimizations</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>If your optimization process doesn&rsquo;t have checkpoints, it&rsquo;s much harder to measure your
improvements.</li>
<li>If your optimization process doesn&rsquo;t have checkpoints, it&rsquo;s much harder to give your
QA / alpha-testers / post-CI testing process time to confirm that your optimizations
have not broken your code.</li>
<li>If your optimization process doesn&rsquo;t have checkpoints, you risk the chance of the
entire process being dropped without results when it ends up being longer and more
complicated than expected.</li>

    A story
  </h2>
</div><p class="component-content component">Fast forward a few more years. Firefox had lost many add-ons, but was now a fast and reliable browser, once
again. It felt good. Developers, who were all Firefox users, finally could brag that their browser felt
smoother than it ever had. Benchmarks were green. Also, the switch to the new add-ons model and to the
multi-process architecture has enabled considerable cleanups, which made the codebase much fitter for
further optimizations.</p>
<p class="component-content component">But still, Performance Telemetry insisted that Firefox was slow for a non-negligible percentage of
users. No developers could ever reproduce these slowdowns, so surely, it had to be some kind of mistake?
Some exotic configuration? Perhaps unreliable GPU drivers? Some buggy anti-virus that drained all CPU?
Surely this could be ignored?</p>
<p class="component-content component">Until one day, one developer-turned-manager decided to try something different. He ordered a bunch of low-end laptops,
the ones that you probably never use if you read (or write) this blog. Not even the kind of laptop that you
can find for cheap in supermarkets, but the kind of laptop that you could find last year in a supermarket.
He then proceeded to distribute these laptops to performance developers.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Everybody had to agree that there was still some work to do on the performance front.</p>

<div class="component-content pagebody component">
  <h2 id="drawing-lessons-2" class="pagebody-header">

  </h2>
</div><p class="component-content component">Once again, this is a case in which things worked fairly well, even if it took some time to get there:</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ol>
<li>Developers were dogfooding their product.</li>
<li>There were a fair number of benchmarks (both micro-benchmarks and end-to-end benchmarks).</li>
<li>There were additional safeguards, such as alpha testers.</li>
<li>Firefox had Performance Telemetry, which measured real-world performance and trends.</li>
<li>A team was looking the results of Performance Telemetry and taking notes on surprising results.</li>
<li>Someone was really motivated to dig into the notes.</li>
</ol></div>
<p class="component-content component">Very few organizations have all these steps. And while steps 1-5 worked and caught numerous
issues, none of them noticed this particular issue. Once again, all these steps were in place
<em>before</em> the optimization work started.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Now, let&rsquo;s unpack this. Your primary tool for measuring improvements are benchmarks
(and, at a later stage, profiling data). They are incredibly useful, but they&rsquo;re also lies. Your
JIT, your optimizing compiler, your CPU cache, your disk cache, your OS, your router,
your semi-hardware battery monitor are all conspiring to make every number you get
from a benchmark unreliable. Or, as the saying goes, &ldquo;The second algorithm is always
faster.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="component-content component"><strong>Lesson 7</strong> Use benchmark but don&rsquo;t trust them.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>The numbers given by a benchmark are incredibly noisy.</li>
<li>The numbers given by a benchmark are useless if your machine is doing anything else.</li>
<li>The evolution of numbers given by a benchmark is useless if you have upgraded your machine.</li>
<li>The evolution of numbers given by a benchmark is useless if you have updated your OS.</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="component-content component">Corollary: You need a dedicated machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="component-content component">Of course, as we&rsquo;ve seen, benchmark numbers are not sufficient. You&rsquo;re going to need
real-world numbers. That&rsquo;s what Firefox is doing (yes, we learnt that
from Chrome). This is the mechanism known as Performance Telemetry, or simply Telemetry,
and it&rsquo;s about phoning home with (anonymous) performance information. It is of course
easier if you own the device phoning home (i.e. if you&rsquo;re writing a backend application),
but it can be deployed to just almost any device with connectivity. Just be certain that
Telemetry doesn&rsquo;t mess up with your optimizations (on a low-powered device, sending data
can be costly) <strong>and doesn&rsquo;t leak privacy information</strong>. Also, please think carefully
about the privacy implications of Telemetry and think whether it can/should be opt-in
or opt-out.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Note that Telemetry data is even more noisy than benchmark data. If you have many users,
they will be running your code on a variety of devices, network or OS configurations,
concurrently with any number of other applications, or your numbers may be affected by a
user putting their laptop to sleep. Experience indicates that Telemetry is even affected
by religious festivals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="component-content component"><strong>Lesson 8</strong> Use real-world data but don&rsquo;t trust it either.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>If you&rsquo;re not measuring real-world performance, you have no idea whether you have improved anything.</li>
<li>If you have not started measuring real-world performance <em>before you start optimizing</em>, you have no
idea whether you have improved anything.</li>
<li>If it&rsquo;s possible, don&rsquo;t forget to include your cost in your measures.</li>
<li>Real-world performance is incredibly noisy.</li>
</ul></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="component-content component">So if benchmark data is noisy and real-world performance data is even more noisy, how can
you trust these numbers? You can&rsquo;t. However, if 5% of your users start having performance
issues regularly, there are really good chances that performance has regressed.
It is time to investigate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="component-content component"><strong>Lesson 9</strong> Extract reliable data from unreliable data.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>Graph the evolution of your median performance. It will show you how you&rsquo;re doing
on average.</li>
<li>For each metric, graph the evolution of the percentage of samples with unacceptable
performance. It will show you how you&rsquo;re doing in the worst case.</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="component-content component">This applies both to benchmarks and to real-world data.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Corollary: You need to have decided what &ldquo;unacceptable performance&rdquo; means. You can
have more than one threshold (e.g. barely acceptable/unacceptable/unusable).</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="component-content component">Chances are that you will always have samples with unacceptable performance, because
of the noise.</p>
<p class="component-content component">And now that we have numbers, we can safely ignore them, right?</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="component-content component"><strong>Lesson 10</strong> Raise alarms.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>Numbers are useless if you don&rsquo;t look at them.</li>
<li>Raise the alarm if your median performance dips.</li>
<li>Raise the alarm if your number of sample with unacceptable performance raises
above some unacceptability threshold.</li>
<li>Just as performance is a feature, a performance alert is a bug.</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="component-content component">Corollary: You need to have decided what &ldquo;unacceptability threshold means&rdquo;. Given
that measures are noisy, 0 is probably not an acceptable answer.</p>

    A story
  </h2>
</div><p class="component-content component">The loop is almost complete. We&rsquo;re close to where we began.
At the time, there was no good way to
determine where time went. Certainly, Firefox took too long to save its state,
or to launch, or to scroll down, but why? Was it because of too much CPU used?
Was the code using the disk too much? Was there a complexity issue in the
garbage-collector?</p>
<p class="component-content component">Certainly, Telemetry could answer some of these questions. But adding Telemetry
probes to each line of the code was out of the question. So developers needed
a tool that could tell them, on their own computer, where the time went.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Some operating systems come with mechanisms that let code ask these questions
to the OS and extract precise performance data. Experiments were made to take
advantage of these mechanisms, but they proved disappointing, in part because
only the computer&rsquo;s administrator had any right to perform such measures.
Still, Firefox developers made use of these tools when they could.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Similarly, existing profiling tools, while useful, didn&rsquo;t work well with
a codebase that mixed several languages on the stack – in the case of Firefox,
the JavaScript used both by webpages, add-ons and most of the user interface,
and the C++ used by most of the backend. Still, Firefox developers also
made use of these tools, on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="component-content component">In the end, one lone developer (not the same) rolled up his sleeves, taught
himself how to write a profiler and did exactly that. He then expanded his
profiler to interact with the JavaScript VM, to extract developer-readable
stacks of JavaScript from mess of JIT-compiled assembly language.
Furthermore, he exposed APIs that other developers could use to instrument
Firefox, indicating e.g. I/O operations or DOM operations, at ~zero performance
cost.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Finally, Firefox developers, add-on developers and, soon, web developers
had an almost-one-click access to performance information that they could
use to make Firefox or their websites faster.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Another lone developer also rolled up his sleeves, taught himself how to
access real-time performance data from the CPU and how context-switching
between C++ and JavaScript worked within Firefox, and took upon himself to
instrument Firefox to further attribute performance information to individual
webpages and add-ons, in such a format that add-on developers could be
informed if their add-ons were causing slowdowns. Much to his chagrin,
the resources to get in touch with add-on developers never materialized.</p>

</div><p class="component-content component">So, what went well and what went wrong?</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ol>
<li>Through Performance Telemetry, developers could get an idea of which part
of the code encountered performance issues. This mechanism was not
sufficiently precise to guide optimizations through the entire process,
but it did its job quite well.</li>
<li>There were native tools, including native profilers and native probes,
and Firefox developers made use of them. Without these tools, the
considerable improvements to SpiderMonkey or other modules would not
have been possible in the first place.</li>
<li>In the end, tools adapted to the technology were even better. But building
these tools had a cost.</li>
<li>As we discussed previously, sometimes, the costs pile up and some optimization
work (or in this case, optimization tooling) is dropped before it can become
useful.</li>
</ol></div>
<p class="component-content component">Your situation is, most likely, different. For one thing, it is fairly unlikely
that you&rsquo;ll need to come up with your own profiler.</p>
<p class="component-content component">However, one thing remains: the tools we have discussed in previous sections will
let you monitor optimizations and the need for them, but they are not sufficient
to investigate inefficiencies in depth. For that, you&rsquo;ll need some
kind of profiler, whether it&rsquo;s a performance profiler, a memory profiler, a
network profiler, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="component-content component"><strong>Lesson 11</strong> Profile, profile, profile.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>Your profiler shows you the biggest inefficiences in your code/system.</li>
<li>Your profiler is usually not as stable as a benchmark.</li>
<li>Your profiler is definitely not as realistic as real-world data.</li>
<li>Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s your best friend.</li>
</ul></div>
</blockquote>
<p class="component-content component">A profiler will put you on the right track. A profiler will let you approach
the problem from the outside, as an investigation. How simple the investigation
will be depends on how many layers of abstraction you need to peel before you
reach the culprit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="component-content component"><strong>Lesson 12</strong> Explicit is better than implicit.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>Your GC will make performance decisions without your knowledge.</li>
<li>Your ORM will make performance decisions without your knowledge.</li>
<li>Your API SDK will make performance decisions without your knowledge.</li>
<li>Any operation that performs magic on your behalf makes performance
decisions without your knowledge.</li>
<li>Your programming language makes performance decisions without your
knowledge.</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="component-content component">Corollary: You will need to find the toggles for these performance
decisions, if they exist.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Corollary: If the toggles do not exist, you&rsquo;re in for turbulent times.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Corollary: For performance, prefer an ecosystem that favors explicit
choices over implicit choices.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Corollary: The programming language + framework you used for prototyping
may not be adapted once you have reached the need for performance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="component-content component">One of the pitfalls of using <em>ecosystems</em> such as Python&rsquo;s or Node&rsquo;s is that they can
easily get you some of the way towards your performance objectives, but that
after the easy wins, the road suddenly becomes nightmarish.</p>
<p class="component-content component">If you reach the stage at which you need to optimize, chances are that
you will do it much more efficiently in an ecosystem that is more designed
towards a final product, even if that ecosystem is less efficient for
coming up with prototypes.</p>

</div><p class="component-content component">Let us finish where we started, with our valiant developer fighting to get file I/O
out of any performance-critical section.</p>
<p class="component-content component">If you recall, our developer was thwarted for a time by a nested event loop. That
nested event loop was a leftover from previous work on improving the performance
of another feature. Fixing the ensuing explosion required much more work than
either moving the file I/O to a background thread or improving the performance
of that other feature in the first place.</p>

</div><p class="component-content component">As you work towards optimization, you will often make your code more complicated
and possibly less fragile.
Whether you add fastpaths, move algorithms across threads or processes, rework
data structures to take less memory, add or remove laziness, deploy external
caches, introduce custom allocators&hellip; your logics will be more complicated
to follow and it may introduce subtle bugs.</p>
<p class="component-content component">That&rsquo;s an expected part of the cost. But there are things that you can do
to keep it contained.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="component-content component"><strong>Lesson 13</strong> Contain your optimizations</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t document your performance choices, expect people to undo them by accident.</li>
