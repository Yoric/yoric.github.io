      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent publications by &lt;a href=&#34;https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Memory-Safety-Convening-Report-1-1.pdf&#34;&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://media.defense.gov/2022/Nov/10/2003112742/-1/-1/0/CSI_SOFTWARE_MEMORY_SAFETY.PDF&#34;&gt;NSA&lt;/a&gt; have launched countless conversations in development circles about &lt;em&gt;safety&lt;/em&gt; and its benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these conversations, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many misunderstandings about what safety means in programming and how programming languages can implement, help or hinder safety. Let&amp;rsquo;s clarify a few things.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Moderated Federated Networks might actually be what we need - part 1</title>
      <link>https://yoric.github.io/post/federated-moderation-is-hard/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Among the many &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; moments of this ending year 2022, we have had the chance of
seeing the Twitter/Musk experiment unfold. I won&amp;rsquo;t spend time rehashing the many twists
of this experiment, just a moment to offer the best wishes to all who work or worked at
Twitter, in particular those being offered as scapegoats for the many sins of the C-suit,
both past and present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m going to spend time on is moderation. If we listen to the official discourse, this
entire Twitter/Musk experiment is about moderation. Also, as a direct consequence of aid
experiment, the number of users on Federated Networks such as Matrix and Mastodon has never
been so high. And Twitter, both past and present, has been a permanent demonstration that
moderation is hard. So&amp;hellip; what does it change to moderate a Federated Network?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: it&amp;rsquo;s harder, but not impossible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The web is getting darker. It is being weaponized by trolls, bullies and bad actors and, as we&amp;rsquo;ve witnessed, this can have extremely grave consequences for individuals, groups, sometimes entire countries. So far, most of the counter-measures proposed by either governments or private actors are even scarier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creators of the Matrix protocol have recently published &lt;a href=&#34;https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix-without-backdoors&#34;&gt;the most promising plan I have seen&lt;/a&gt;. One that I believe stands a chance of making real headway in this fight, while respecting openness, decentralization, open-source and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been offered the opportunity to work on this plan. For this reason, after 9 years as an employee at &lt;a href=&#34;https://mozilla.org&#34;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;ll be moving to &lt;a href=&#34;https://element.io&#34;&gt;Element&lt;/a&gt;, where I&amp;rsquo;ll try and contribute to making the web a better place. My last day at Mozilla will be October 30th.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On this rainy october day (well, at least it rains where I&amp;rsquo;m writing this) of the great year 2020, let&amp;rsquo;s take another few minutes to reflect on &lt;a href=&#34;https://yoric.github.io/tags/mozgreatstuff/&#34;&gt;some great practices that we have at Mozilla and that would deserve to take over the world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Until now, this blog has been using Disqus as a comment mechanism.
While it is very useful, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to switch to a less invasive (and I believe more privacy-safe): gitalk.
I&amp;rsquo;ve left Disqus on in the pages on which users had already left comments. For other pages, Disqus is now deactivated.</description>

      <title>about:Mozilla&#39;s Mentored Bugs - and how it could work for your project</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2020 is a crappy year for pretty much everyone. As you may have seen, this includes organizations such as Mozilla. So I figured it was the best time to actually talk about good stuff! This entry should be the first of a series of short articles dedicated to some great practices we have at Mozilla and that I think many open-source projects could adopt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its core, Mozilla is a community of open-source enthusiasts. When you&amp;rsquo;re new to an open-source community and you wish to start contributing somewhere, finding an entry point is often difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where &lt;strong&gt;Mentored Bugs&lt;/strong&gt; come in.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Did Mozilla Remove XUL Add-ons?</title>
      <link>https://yoric.github.io/post/why-did-mozilla-remove-xul-addons/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 20 Aug 2020 18:09:36 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yoric.github.io/post/why-did-mozilla-remove-xul-addons/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Firefox used to have a great extension mechanism based on the XUL and XPCOM. This mechanism served us well for a long time. However, it came at an ever-growing cost in terms of maintenance for both Firefox developers and add-on developers. On one side, this growing cost progressively killed any effort to make Firefox secure, fast or to try new things. On the other side, this growing cost progressively killed the community of add-on developers. Eventually, after spending years trying to protect this old add-on mechanism, Mozilla made the hard choice of removing this extension mechanism and replacing this with the less powerful but much more maintainable WebExtensions API. Thanks to this choice, Firefox developers can once again make the necessary changes to improve security, stability or speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the past few days, I&amp;rsquo;ve been chatting with Firefox users, trying to separate fact from rumor regarding the consequences of the August 2020 Mozilla layoffs. One of the topics that came back a few times was the removal of XUL-based add-ons during the move to Firefox Quantum. I was very surprised to see that, years after it happened, some community members still felt hurt by this choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, as someone pointed out on reddit, I realized that we still haven&amp;rsquo;t taken the time to explain in-depth why we &lt;em&gt;had no choice&lt;/em&gt; but to remove XUL-based add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, if you&amp;rsquo;re ready for a dive into some of the internals of add-ons and Gecko, I&amp;rsquo;d like to take this opportunity to try and give you a bit more detail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Possibly one step towards named arguments in Rust</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A number of programming languages offer a feature called &amp;ldquo;Named Arguments&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Labeled Arguments&amp;rdquo;, which
makes some function calls much more readable and safer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s see how hard it would be to add these in Rust.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Years ago, Andrew Kennedy published &lt;a href=&#34;http://typesatwork.imm.dtu.dk/material/TaW_Paper_TypesAtWork_Kennedy.pdf&#34;&gt;a foundational paper&lt;/a&gt; about a type checker for units of measure, and later &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/andrewkennedy/units-of-measure-in-f-part-one-introducing-units&#34;&gt;implemented it for
F#&lt;/a&gt;. To this day, F# is the only mainstream programming language which provides first class support to make sure that you will not accidentally confuse meters and feet, euros and dollars, but that you can still convert between watts·hours and joules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to see whether this could be implemented in and for Rust. The answer is not only yes, but it was fun :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I have decided to keep this blog for professional use and move everything related to storytelling, role-playing games or improv acting to a new location.
Without further ado, let me introduce Space·Time Will Tell!
At the menu:
a comic book tutorial for Fate RPG! using Tarot-like cards for storytelling! several elevator pitches for stories I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the time to write! the Space·Time Deck! the Ronin Time Bureaucrats! adventure and excitement!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I&amp;rsquo;m not busy attempting to reduce the startup time and power requirements of web pages with the JavaScript Binary AST, I&amp;rsquo;m into Improv Acting and Role-Playing Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;d like to introduce a hobby project of mine, which I have started over the summer: Ronin Time Bureaucrats – an narrative/improv Role-Playing Game of Handwavy Time Paradoxes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Thinkerbell Postmortem/Brain dump</title>
      <link>https://yoric.github.io/post/thinkerbell-postmortem/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Mar 2018 08:50:05 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yoric.github.io/post/thinkerbell-postmortem/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two years ago, I was working on a research project called &amp;ldquo;Project Link&amp;rdquo; as part of
the Connected Devices branch of Mozilla. While this branch has since been stopped,
some part of Project Link lives on as &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2018/02/06/announcing-project-things-open-framework-connecting-devices-web/&#34;&gt;Project Things&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the parts of Project Link that hasn&amp;rsquo;t made it to Project Things (so far)
was Thinkerbell: a Domain-Specific Language designed to let users program their SmartHome
without coding. While only parts of Thinkerbell were ever implemented, they were sufficient
to write programs such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever I press any button labelled &amp;ldquo;light&amp;rdquo; in the living room, toggle all the lights in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the entry door is locked and the motion detector notices motion, send an alarm to my SmartPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinkerbell also had:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;semantics that ensured that scripts could continue/resume running unmonitored even when hardware
was replaced/upgraded/moved around the house, including both the server and the sensors;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a visual syntax, rather than a text syntax;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a novel type system designed to avoid physical accidents;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a semantics based on process algebras.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I&amp;rsquo;d like to take the time to write a research paper on Thinkerbell, but
realistically, there is very little chance that I&amp;rsquo;ll find that time.
So, rather than letting these ideas die in some corner of my brain, here is a post-mortem
for Thinkerbell, in the hope that someone, somewhere, will pick some of the stuff and gives
it a second life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that some of the ideas exposed here were never actually implemented. Project Link
was cancelled while Thinkerbell was still in its infancy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>HolyJIT: Could we write a multi-staged JIT compiler?</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;rsquo;m the author of this blog post, 99% of the work was done by Nicolas B. Pierron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, my role in this project has largely been to play the wise old advisor,
nodding and smiling mischeviously whenever Nicolas started exploring new ideas,
and emitting cryptic comments in Reverse Jedi Notation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, we published a &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.mozilla.org/javascript/2017/10/20/holyjit-a-new-hope/&#34;&gt;short (and mysterious) blog post&lt;/a&gt; in which we
mentioned HolyJIT, an early research project towards a novel approach to writing JITs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, I would like to detail a bit more the ideas behind HolyJIT.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this entry, I’d like to discuss one of the most interesting and unusual aspects of the Binary AST: how we gain performance by turning &lt;em&gt;proof-building&lt;/em&gt; into &lt;em&gt;validation&lt;/em&gt;, and why this is very good news for performance (and maybe not so good news for file size).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, the Rust language was a language with typestate. Officially, typestates were dropped long before Rust 1.0. In this entry, I’ll get you in on the worst kept secret of the Rust community: Rust still has typestates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The key to making programs fast is to make them do practically nothing.&amp;rdquo; - Mike Haertel, creator of GNU Grep.
Binary AST - &amp;ldquo;Binary Abstract Syntax Tree&amp;rdquo; - is Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s proposal for specifying a binary-encoded syntax for JS with the intent of allowing browsers and other JS-executing environments to parse and load code as much as 80% faster than standard minified JS.
It has recently cleared Stage 1 of the TC39 standards process, and while the final byte-level format isn&amp;rsquo;t completely nailed down, we&amp;rsquo;re confident that the final implementation will deliver the impressive performance improvements promised by the prototype.</description>

      <description>Hey, all cool kids have exciting Engineering Newsletters these days, so it&amp;rsquo;s high time the JavaScript Binary AST got one!
Summary JavaScript Binary AST is a joint project between Mozilla and Facebook to rethink how JavaScript source code is stored/transmitted/parsed. We expect that this project will help visibly speed up the loading of large codebases of JS applications and will have a large impact on the JS development community, including both web developers, Node developers, add-on developers and ourselves.</description>

      <description>In this blog post, I would like to introduce the JavaScript Binary AST, an ongoing project that we hope will help make webpages load faster, along with a number of other benefits.
A little background Over the years, JavaScript has grown from one of the slowest scripting languages available to a high-performance powerhouse, fast enough that it can run desktop, server, mobile and even embedded applications, whether through web browsers or other environments.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago, Mozilla pulled the plug on its Connected Devices Experiment: a bunch of internal non-profit hardware-related startups. One of our main objectives was to determine if we could come up with designs that could help turn the tide against the spyware-riddled and gruyère-level security devices that are currently being offered (or pushed) to unwary users.
One of the startups was Project Lighthouse. We tried to provide an affordable, simple and privacy-friendly tool for people suffering from vision impairment and who needed help in their daily life.</description>

      <title>Things to do before you[r project] die[s]</title>
      <link>https://yoric.github.io/post/how-to-survive/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2017 00:10:34 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://yoric.github.io/post/how-to-survive/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that all projects die, eventually, and that most projects die
before they have had a chance to have any impact. This is true of personal projects,
of open-source projects, of startup projects, of hardware projects, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few days ago, &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Connected_Devices/Projects/Project_Lighthouse&#34;&gt;the IoT project on which I was working&lt;/a&gt;
did just that. It was funded, it was open-source, it was open-hardware, and it
still died before having the opportunity to release anything useful. In our case,
we got pretty far, didn&amp;rsquo;t run out of funds, and were a little polish away from
putting our first alpha-testers in front of a pretty advanced prototype before
a higher-level strategy pivot killed a number of projects at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ah, well, risks of the trade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, working on it, we managed to learn or come up with a few tricks
to increase the chances of surviving at least long enough to release a product.
I&amp;rsquo;ll try to summarize and explain some of these tricks here. Hopefully, if you
have a project, regardless of funding and medium, you may find some of this
summary useful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
