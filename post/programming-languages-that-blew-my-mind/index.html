<p class="component-content component">Ranking by order in which I discovered these languages. In most cases, I&rsquo;m
going to attach features to languages that were not the first language to
have such features. It&rsquo;s not meant to be a misattribution, just to showcase
how I was exposed to such features.</p>

<div class="component-content pagebody component">
  <h1 id="basichttpsenwikipediaorgwikibasic" class="pagebody-header">
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">Basic</a>
  </h1>
</div><p class="component-content component">A language designed to make programming simple.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>Mind blown: Programming my own games!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Arrays (or <code>DIM</code>, as they were called)!</li>
<li>Mind blown: <code>GOTO</code>!</li>
<li>Mind blown: <code>GOSUB</code>!</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="component-content component">Original, line-based, Basic is dead, but its legacy lives on in VB.Net, VBA,
but also in more subtle manners in today&rsquo;s dynamic languages (Python,
JavaScript, etc.)</p>

<div class="component-content pagebody component">
  <h1 id="turbo-pascalhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiturbo_pascal" class="pagebody-header">
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Pascal">(Turbo) Pascal</a>
  </h1>
</div><p class="component-content component">I guess my most formative language. I released a few applications in Turbo Pascal
as a teenager, including a commercial one (although, to be fair, Alain Frisch did
most of the work).</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>Mind blown: A programming tutorial!</li>
<li>Mind blown: An IDE!</li>
<li>Mind blown: The compiler can actually help you find your errors!</li>
<li>Mind blown: A debugger that is actually useful!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Structured programming!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Units (aka &ldquo;modules&rdquo;)!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Object-Oriented Programming (although it wasn&rsquo;t very useful in the libraries)!</li>
<li>Mind blown: A UI toolkit!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Dynamic memory allocation!</li>
<li>Mind blown: A community of developers (also, SWAGS)!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Memory overlays!</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="component-content component">A few years later, still a teen, I attempted to move to C and was a bit disappointed, only
to find it basically the same language, just harder to read (what&rsquo;s that weird three-components
<code>for</code> loop?), more error-prone (far pointers? really?) and with glaring missing features (what
do you mean, there are no modules?), so I&rsquo;m not going to include C
in this list.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Pascal language still exists a bit as Turbo Pascal, Lazarus Pascal and Delphi, but also lives
on with Ada (for its syntax) and every documentation tool around the sun (JavaDoc, rustdoc,
Sphinx, Doxygen, etc.), as the original documentation tool, WEB, was designed for and with
Turbo Pascal.</p>

<div class="component-content pagebody component">
  <h1 id="x86-asmhttpsenwikipediaorgwikix86_assembly_language" class="pagebody-header">
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language">x86 ASM</a>
  </h1>
</div><p class="component-content component">One of the main limitations of Turbo Pascal was that its BGI (the API to talk to the graphics
adapter) was limited to 16 colors and relatively small resolutions. When more modern graphic
cards appeared, every developer suddenly started learning assembly language to be able to
talk to the devices. I was no exception.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>Mind blown: Memory addressing!</li>
<li>Mind blown: The stack is an illusion!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Interacting with the graphics adapter directly!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Interrupts!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Registers!</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="component-content component">These days, very few people write assembly language manually, because it&rsquo;s not very useful
and it&rsquo;s 100% unportable, but it is of course still present behind the scenes in your
favorite compiler or JIT. Every so often, I see a Rust developer or a C++ developer
showcasing a disassembled version of the binary they have produced and it reminds me
of the (not so) good old times.</p>

<div class="component-content pagebody component">
  <h1 id="hypercardhttpsenwikipediaorgwikihypercard" class="pagebody-header">
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">HyperCard</a>
  </h1>
</div><p class="component-content component">At the other end of the spectrum was HyperCard. A programming language designed for people
who did not want to learn programming languages. It looked like a drawing application but
you could use the built-in language to customize it into a full IDE, as well as to write
new programs.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>Mind blown: Customizing your environment.</li>
<li>Mind blown: My first scripting language, although I didn&rsquo;t realize at the time.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Almost natural language programming.</li>
<li>Mind blown: The Stack, the Templates, aka my first UX abstractions.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Programming as a form of conversation between the programmer and the computer.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Garbage-collection (although I didn&rsquo;t realize at the time).</li>
<li>Mind blown (backwards): Impossible to port code to non-Apple platforms, which is probably one of the
reasons I mostly stick with open-source these days.</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="component-content component">Arguably, this language is the core inspiration for everything &ldquo;visual&rdquo;, from Visual Basic
to Visual Studio to every tool that you can use to draw a UX. Also, to some extent, the
web itself traces some of its roots to HyperCard. Every so often, I see a
revival of some descendent of HyperCard, but they don&rsquo;t seem to stick.</p>
<p class="component-content component">SmallTalk shares of course many of these ideas and was possibly even more revolutionary,
but I learnt SmallTalk much later, so it was too late to blow my mind on these specific
points!</p>

<div class="component-content pagebody component">
  <h1 id="ocamlhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiocaml" class="pagebody-header">
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml">(O)Caml</a>
  </h1>
</div><p class="component-content component">Caml (then OCaml) came at me by surprise. I was a jaded 1st year student, convinced that I knew everything under
the sun since I had released commercial software, and I had taken the habit of being better at
programming that the teachers in charge of programming in high school, which of course meant
that I was the best there was. I read the documentation of OCaml before
the first lesson and misunderstood &ldquo;polymorphism&rdquo; (we call it &ldquo;generics&rdquo; these days) as
&ldquo;weakly typed&rdquo;. Boy was I wrong. During the first lesson, the professor showed us how
to walk a tree in OCaml. It was <em>so</em> concise, <em>so</em> robust and <em>so</em> readable. Also,
the professor was actually a strong developer and the author of one of the first
word processors, so this course also became a much needed lesson in humility.</p>
<p class="component-content component">I feel in love with OCaml. It quickly became my main programming language, until I burnt
out while using it to develop Opalang.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>Mind blown: Parametric polymorphism (aka &ldquo;generics&rdquo;)!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Type inference!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Garbage-collection!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Pattern-matching!</li>
<li>Mind blown: The REPL!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Higher-order programming!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Monads!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Continuation-Passing Style!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Message-Passing Concurrency with arbitrary messages (including channels)!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Polymorphic variants and row polymorphism (aka &ldquo;static duck typing&rdquo;)!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Customizable syntax!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Writing DSLs!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Multistage programming!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Type-level programming between modules!</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="component-content component">OCaml is still very much active. It&rsquo;s used to develop programming languages (including the
original Rust prototypes), static analysis tools for nuclear plants, operating systems
for satellites and other situations that require an extremely high level of safety.
It is also one of the immediate ancestors of Rust,
F#, Elm, ReasonML and, if my memory serves, the first version of React. Oh, and also
Opalang. For some reason, message-passing concurrency seems to be marketed as &ldquo;gochannels&rdquo;
these days, but as far as I can tell, they date back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrent_ML">Concurrent ML</a>,
one of the ancestors of OCaml.</p>

  <h1 id="javahttpsenwikipediaorgwikijava_programming_language" class="pagebody-header">
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>
  </h1>
</div><p class="component-content component">I started Java when I was trying to modernize some code I&rsquo;d written Turbo Pascal
and finally get it to work on both Linux, Windows and System 7 (the ancestor
of macOS). I found the language verbose, I couldn&rsquo;t understand why they
didn&rsquo;t ship an installer given how complicated it was to ship and/or run
classes and I really missed generics, algebraic data types or pattern-matching,
but Java became my baseline language for a while – not as good as OCaml in my
books, but with access to better libraries.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>Mind blown: A standard library that felt like it contained everything I needed!</li>
<li>Mind blown: A documentation that was meant to be understood by its users!</li>
<li>Mind blown: The JVML!</li>
<li>Mind blown: A UX toolkit that was very simple to use (even if the results were disappointing)!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Synchronization as a language primitive (even if wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a great idea)!</li>
<li>Mind blown: <code>finally</code>!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Just in Time compilation!</li>
<li>Mind blown backwards: Understanding how <code>finally</code> was implemented in the JVM.</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="component-content component">These days, Java is of course one of the pillars of the industry. It&rsquo;s also

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a>
  </h1>
</div><p class="component-content component">If you have never coded in Prolog, I can only recomment giving it a try.
It will absolutely change how you think of programs.
In Prolog, you don&rsquo;t write algorithms, you teach the program how to think.
Writing a simple path finder is something you can do in about 2-4
trivial rules. Writing a simple type system is barely longer.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>Mind blown: Teaching the program how to think!</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="component-content component">These days, Prolog itself has mostly vanished. However, its legacy is impressive.
If my memory serves, SQL is largely based on a subset of Prolog, with a
large focus on optimization at the expense of simplicity. The C++ template
system is largely a more complicated reimplementation of Prolog. Parts of
Rust&rsquo;s type system are being rewritten with Chalk, a descendent of Prolog.</p>
<p class="component-content component">I somewhat suspect that, one of these days, someone will start combining
LLMs with Prolog (or Coq) to build something reliable on top of ChatGPT.
Also, I have recently stumbled upon TypeDB, which looks very much like
a new generation of Prolog, with a relational database-like API.</p>

  <h1 id="coqhttpsenwikipediaorgwikicoq_software" class="pagebody-header">
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq_(software)">Coq</a>
  </h1>
</div><p class="component-content component">Coq (and its cousins, Twelf, Isabel, &hellip;) is something different entirely.
You encode your entire specifications as types. These types are your goal.
You don&rsquo;t program by looking at your functions, your libraries, but by
looking at your types using tools that transform your types to simplify
them gradually into independent subgoals. One way to describe it is that
instead of coding, you are solving a puzzle. Of course, your subgoals
end up being your functions, your data structures, your modules. But
that&rsquo;s almost accidental.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Oh, and course,, the type-checker is so powerful that your program is
actually a formal, mathematically verified proof that it fulfills the
specifications. A number of mathematical theorems have been verified
by turning them into Coq.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>Mind blown: Types as specifications.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Programs as proofs.</li>
<li>Mind blown: When the lemma is simple, just ask Coq to write the function for you!</li>
<li>Mind blown: Higher kinds.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Passionate debates about whether the brain or the computer is the most trustworthy mathematician.</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="component-content component">I haven&rsquo;t followed development on Coq and other languages of the family in the while.
As far as I understand, they&rsquo;re still quite used in academia, where they have served
to formally prove compliance of compilers and OS kernels. I suspect that if Prolog
doesn&rsquo;t come back to create reliable LLMs, someone will use Coq or Idris to do so.</p>

  </h1>
</div><p class="component-content component">Erlang (and now Elixir) is and remains <em>the</em> language for distribution. A core
much simpler than Python, but that scaled easily to millions of nodes.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>Mind blown: Distributed systems, trivially.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Deploying new code from the language by sending closures.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Let it fail design.</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="component-content component">While many people still haven&rsquo;t heard about Erlang/Elixir, this language has
been used in the industry since the 90s, for highly distributed systems.
The ecosystem is very much alive and a static type system is currently
being tested. The let it fail model is used by mobile operating systems.
The concurrency and distribution models have trickled to Scala, Go and
pretty much everything that contains the words &ldquo;microservices&rdquo; or &ldquo;actors&rdquo;.
In fact I am a bit sad whenever I see microservices or Kafka, as they are largely
reimplementations of the design of Erlang/Elixir and the underlying BEAM Virtual
Machine, but based on technologies that are much harder to use and deploy and
protocols that are several orders of magnitude slower.</p>
<p class="component-content component">Oh, Opalang borrows from Erlang, too.</p>

  </h1>
</div><p class="component-content component">I&rsquo;m cheating here. The π-calculus (&ldquo;pi-calculus&rdquo;) is not a programming language
but a calculus, i.e. a mathematical model designed to reason about systems. This
model can be fully defined with only a dozen lines of specification and is also
pretty trivial to implement. It has been used to perform static analysis on
models of cryptographic protocols, or banking protocols&hellip; and also biological
processes. I&rsquo;ve used it to define a type system that developers could theoretically
use to guarantee that their protocols would degrade nicely in presence of a (D)DoS
attack.</p>

  </h1>
</div><p class="component-content component">This one is a bit special, as I joined the team and became the lead designer
for the language for a while. Imagine writing a single codebase in a
simple functional + actor-based language comparable to OCaml/F#/ReasonML/Elm
or a statically typed Erlang,
then having the compiler analyze the code for safety, security <em>and distribution</em>, then split
it into client-side code (compiled to JavaScript + HTML + CSS), server-side
code (compiled to native) and database-side code (compiled into a db schema
and compiled queries).</p>
<p class="component-content component">I fell in love with the language. Then got burnt out designing, developing
and evangelizing it in a toxic environment. Took me some time to get back
in the field of programming language design after that.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>Mind blown: Automated splitting between client, server and database.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Statically-typed HTML.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Eliminating most of OWASP&rsquo;s top 10 security issues, automatically.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Automated distribution between web servers (although we overcomplicated
that a bit).</li>
<li>Mind blown: Type systems for security analysis.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Asynchronous fibers in JavaScript (before <code>Promise</code>,
<code>async</code>/<code>await</code> or DOM Workers).</li>
<li>Mind blown: Data structure-oriented database.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Distributed, scalable database (although sadly, we made mistakes
and it ended up pretty slow in practice).</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="component-content component">I think that Opalang (and its cousins ReSharper and Ur/Web) was a bit too much in
advance for its time. The entire idea of multi-tier programming seems to have been
vanished into oblivion. Perhaps it will resurface some day – WASM should make this
much easier.</p>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">Rust</a>
  </h1>
</div><p class="component-content component">I fell in love again with Rust. It combined most of the benefits of OCaml or Haskell
with the promise of writing highly concurrent code and system-level development. Also,
at the time, revolutionary ideas for modular garbage-collection and M:N scheduling,
although these ideas were dumped before 1.0. At the time I started tinkering with the
language, it was very much a research project. I remember some of the early
conversations we&rsquo;ve had on error-handling or strings or iterators. One of the high
marks on my resume is that I&rsquo;m one of the people who introduced the idea of the
<code>try!</code> macro, which since then graduated into operator <code>?</code>.</p>
<div class="component-content component"><ul>
<li>Mind blown: Using affine datatypes to prove typestate properties.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Writing code on par with C++ performance, but with OCaml-level guarantees.</li>
<li>Mind blown: An efficient compilation model for <code>async</code>/<code>await</code>.</li>
<li>Mind blown: How well the type system leads to safe concurrent solutions.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Didactic error messages.</li>
<li>Mind blown: The friendly pre-RFC/RFC process.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Cargo and the crates ecosystem.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Opinionated unit testing.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Doc testing.</li>
<li>Mind blown: A friendly and welcoming community.</li>
<li>Mind blown: Some support for writing my own gradual type system.</li>
</ul></div>
<p class="component-content component">I haven&rsquo;t had much time to contribute to the compiler or stdlib in a while, but
I&rsquo;m planning to return to it once I have some free time!</p>
<p class="component-content component">Sadly, I think that Rust has spoilt me for many other languages. Now, whenever I write
Python or Go (both of which I currently do for a living) or even TypeScript, I&rsquo;m always
cringing at the prospect of my code blowing up as soon as I run it. With Rust, I encode
as many properties as I reasonably can within the type system, which means that I need
to think more before I code, but also that tests usuall pass the first time.</p>

Haskell, Scheme, SmallTalk, (Tw)elf, Idris, Python, Go, PHP, Perl, Bash, C, C++, JoCaml,
JavaScript, TypeScript, Scala, C#, F#, Visual Basic, Ruby, (D)TAL, Squeak, Logo,
Scratch, UnrealScript, GDScript, Lua, SQL&hellip;</p>
<p class="component-content component">If I didn&rsquo;t include them, it&rsquo;s because they didn&rsquo;t blow my mind. Which doesn&rsquo;t mean that
these languages are not great or innovative. Just that the concepts either didn&rsquo;t resonate
with me <em>or</em>, more often than not, that I had already discovered these same concepts with
other languages, just by the luck of the order in which I learnt languages.</p>

</div><p class="component-content component">I haven&rsquo;t seen anything revolutionary in a while, but this doesn&rsquo;t mean anything.
The next idea could be lurking around the corner, in a small research project that
I just haven&rsquo;t heard about.</p>
<p class="component-content component">When I joined PASQAL, I hoped to be wowed by languages for quantum computing. I&rsquo;m
not there yet, but I don&rsquo;t lose hope!</p>
<p class="component-content component">I imagine that, despite the overhype and the insane environmental cost, something
useful will come from ChatGPT and LLMs, but I&rsquo;m yet to see it. So far, I&rsquo;ve seen
interesting experiments and many toys that already feel broken. I wonder what the
future will look like.</p>
